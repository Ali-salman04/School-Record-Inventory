## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A **Netlify** account. You can sign up for free at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
- **Git** installed on your machine.
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed (if your project requires it).

---

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd school-data-inventory
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build the Project

If your project requires a build step (e.g., React, Vue, etc.), run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` or `build` folder containing the production-ready files.

### 4. Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to the [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com).
2. Click on **New site from Git**.
3. Choose your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
4. Authorize Netlify to access your repositories.
5. Select the repository you want to deploy.
6. In the **Branch to deploy** field, select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`).
7. In the **Build command** field, enter the command you used to build your project (e.g., `npm run build`).
8. In the **Publish directory** field, enter the path to your build output (e.g., `dist` or `build`).
9. Click **Deploy site**.

### 5. Wait for Deployment

Netlify will start the deployment process. Once it's complete, you will receive a unique URL for your deployed site.

## Configuring Environment Variables

Some features of this project require environment variables to be set. Follow these steps to configure them in Netlify:

### 1. Go to Site Settings

In your Netlify dashboard, click on your newly created site.

Navigate to the **Site settings** tab.

### 2. Add Environment Variables

Scroll down to the **Build & deploy** section.

Click on **Environment** to expand it.

Click on **Edit variables**.

Add the required environment variables in the format `KEY=VALUE`. For example:

```bash
API_KEY=your_api_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

Click **Save**.

### 3. Re-deploy the Site

After adding the environment variables, you may need to trigger a new deployment for the changes to take effect. You can do this by:

1. Clicking on **Deploys** in the left sidebar.
2. Then clicking **Trigger deploy** > **Clear cache and deploy site**.

## Usage

Once your site is deployed, you can access it using the URL provided by Netlify. You can also make changes to your code, push them to your repository, and Netlify will automatically redeploy your site.
